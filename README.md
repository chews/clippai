## How It Works

Clipp-AI operates by parsing URLs from a JSON file hosted on GitHub. When you navigate to a website, the extension checks if there's a special token `|claudeai|` in the JSON that matches the current domain. If present, Clipp-AI strips the token and sends the remaining text as a prompt to Claude AI.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right corner
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the cloned repository folder

## Configuration

The extension uses a JSON file to determine which domains to activate on and what prompts to send. The format is as follows:

```json
{
  "app.uniswap.com": "|claudeai|How can I swap ethereum for USDC",
  "opensea.com": "|claudeai|I have base eth, how to I buy this NFT?"
}
```

## Usage

Once installed, Clipp-AI will appear on supported websites. Click on Clippy to interact with the AI assistant.
